                    <p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.</p>

                    <p>As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-xl'>How does Node work?</h3>
                    <p>Node JS Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool to provide services to the Client Requests. Node JS Web Server receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known as “Event Queue”. Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop”</p>
